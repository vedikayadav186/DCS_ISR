Natural Language Processing is an important field of Computer Science. 
It focuses on enabling computers to understand human language. 
People speak and write in different ways, so words often appear in various forms. 
To analyze text effectively, these word variations need to be reduced to a common base form. 
This process of reducing related words to a single representative form is known as conflation.
